            Physician coaching is a relationship between two medical professionalsâ€”a conversation among individuals with shared experiences. Our goal is to create a <span className="font-semibold text-blue-900">sacred and safe space</span> for exploration and self-discovery.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Our work is <span className="font-semibold text-blue-900">client-centered, action-oriented, and forward-looking</span>. No matter what is happening in your life, we see you as whole and complete. We have faith in you and your ability to align with your values, rediscover your purpose, and live with intention.
