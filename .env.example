# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Database, locally this will route to the docker container, on production it will route to the remote database simply replace the url and run the db:push command
# Drizzle
# Define all parameters such as the port, and database name aand the start-database.sh script will handle the rest
